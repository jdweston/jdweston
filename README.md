- 👋 Hi, I’m @jdweston  
- 🧠 I’m interested in data engineering, neuroscience, psychology, and how we can apply tech to solve real-world problems in health, behavior, and decision-making.  
- 📟 I’m currently enhancing my skills in Python and SQL while also working on portfolio projects that blend data analysis with psychology and neuroscience.  
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data projects that involve open datasets in mental health, cognitive science, or customer experience analytics.
